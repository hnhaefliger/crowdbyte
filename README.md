# crowdbyte

Crowdbyte was inspired by the work on artificial swarm intelligence done a [Unanimous.ai](https://unanimous.ai).

The principle difference between this and voting is that community members are able to implicity negotiate and update their views in real time to reach a consensus without bias.
